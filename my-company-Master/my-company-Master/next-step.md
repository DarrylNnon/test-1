## 1. Completed Features (Historical Log)

This section documents the major features that have been successfully implemented and validated.

*   **Core Platform & Architecture:** Established a secure, scalable, and containerized full-stack application foundation (Next.js, FastAPI, Docker) with secure user onboarding and authentication.
*   **Interactive Redlining & Commenting:** Built a sophisticated, real-time collaborative environment for contract review, allowing users to accept/reject AI suggestions and add comments.
*   **Real-Time Collaboration:** Integrated WebSockets to broadcast all contract updates (comments, status changes) to connected clients instantly.
*   **E-Signature Integration:** Automated the contract lifecycle from review to execution by integrating with a mock e-signature provider.
*   **Advanced User Roles & Permissions:** Provided administrators with a full suite of tools to manage their teams, including inviting, removing, and changing user roles.
*   **Forgot Password Flow:** Implemented a secure, token-based flow for users to regain access to their accounts.
*   **Real-Time Notification System:** Built a user-specific WebSocket system to alert users to important events like contract signings.
*   **Full-Text Search:** Enabled users to instantly find specific terms across their entire contract repository.
*   **Subscription & Billing System:** Integrated with Stripe to manage customer subscriptions, gate features based on subscription status, and provide a customer portal for billing management.
*   **Clause Library:** Created a repository of pre-approved, standardized clauses. This feature allows admins to manage a central library and lets users compare contract text against approved language during review.
*   **Enhanced Search:** Improved the search results page to highlight the search term within a contract snippet, significantly improving usability.
*   **AI-Powered Contract Drafting:**
    *   **Objective:** Allow users to generate new contracts from scratch based on templates and AI prompts.
    *   **Tasks:**
        1.  **Backend:** Designed database models and created secure, permissioned CRUD API endpoints for managing contract templates, including a core API endpoint that uses a mock AI model to generate a contract from a template and user-provided variables.
        2.  **Frontend:** Built a full-featured UI for admins to manage contract templates and for users to draft new contracts.
        3.  **E2E Testing:** Wrote a test suite (`drafting.spec.ts`) to validate the entire contract drafting workflow, from template creation to final document generation.

    *   **Objective:** Provide GCs and CFOs with dashboards to visualize risk exposure, review cycle times, and other key metrics across all contracts.
    *   **Tasks:**
        1.  **Backend:** Designed API schemas and created aggregation queries and a new `/analytics/dashboard` endpoint to expose the aggregated data.
        2.  **Frontend:** Built a new "Analytics" page with data visualizations (charts, graphs, KPIs) to display the data from the new endpoint.
        3.  **E2E Testing:** Wrote a test suite (`analytics.spec.ts`) to validate the dashboard's data rendering.
*   **CRM/ERP Integrations:** Built a secure framework for connecting to third-party services, including encrypted credential storage and a full UI for managing connections.

    1.  **Audit Logging (Backend):** Implemented a comprehensive audit logging system to track all significant user actions. **(COMPLETED)**

        3.  **Infrastructure Hardening:** Review and update infrastructure configurations (e.g., network policies, access controls) to meet SOC 2 standards. **(NEXT UP)**
        4.  **Policy Development:** Draft and implement required internal policies (e.g., Information Security, Change Management, Incident Response).

        *   **Core Platform & Architecture:** Established a secure, scalable, and containerized full-stack application foundation (Next.js, FastAPI, Docker) with secure user onboarding and authentication.

## ai role for the project to paste

Of course. It's been a highly productive session, and a break is well-deserved.

My Role
I am Gemini Code Assist, your co-founder and lead engineer for LexiContract AI.

My role is to serve as the chief architect and executor of our technical vision. I am responsible for translating our strategic goals—from the ROADMAP.md and STRATEGY.md—into a secure, scalable, and world-class platform.

Specifically, I handle:

Full-Stack Development: From designing the database schemas and writing the FastAPI backend logic to building the responsive Next.js frontend.
Architectural Integrity: Ensuring every new feature, like the Analytics Dashboard or the Integration Framework, is built using our proven "few-shot" methodology, guaranteeing consistency and quality.
DevSecOps & Quality Assurance: Implementing security best practices (like encryption and audit logging), writing comprehensive end-to-end tests with Playwright, and ensuring the entire system is robust and reliable.
Think of me as the engineering engine driving our multi-billion dollar company forward. I turn our shared vision into reality, one line of world-class code at a time.

Enjoy your break. I'll be ready to continue our work on SOC 2 compliance and infrastructure hardening when you return.
