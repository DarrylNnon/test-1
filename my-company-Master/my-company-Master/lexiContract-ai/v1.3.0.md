# Release Notes: Version 1.3.0

**Release Date:** 2023-11-03
**Focus:** Post-Signature Contract Management & Automation

---

## Overview

This release introduces a powerful new suite of **Post-Signature Management** tools. LexiContract AI now extends beyond contract analysis and negotiation to help you actively manage your contracts after they are signed. This transforms your static legal documents into dynamic assets, giving you unprecedented visibility into your rights and obligations and helping you avoid costly missed deadlines.

## âœ¨ New Features

### 1. AI-Powered Milestone & Obligation Extraction
*   When you mark a contract as **"SIGNED"**, our AI now performs a secondary analysis to automatically identify and extract critical post-signature information.
*   **Key Dates:** Effective dates, expiration dates, and renewal notice deadlines are automatically pulled from the text and displayed on a visual timeline.
*   **Key Obligations:** Actionable commitments for both your company and the counterparty (e.g., "Company shall provide a report," "Client is responsible for payment") are extracted and tracked.

### 2. New "Management" Tab on Contracts
*   A dedicated tab is now available on signed contracts, giving you a command center for post-signature tracking.
*   View the **Key Dates Timeline** to see all important deadlines at a glance.
*   Use the **Obligations Table** to view and update the status of each commitment (e.g., from "Pending" to "Completed").

### 3. Renewals Dashboard
*   A new, portfolio-wide **Renewals Dashboard** is now available.
*   Proactively manage your entire contract portfolio by viewing all contracts approaching their expiration or renewal notice dates in the next 30, 60, or 90 days.

### 4. Automated Deadline Reminders
*   Never miss a critical date again. Our new, automated notification service will proactively alert you via email when a contract milestone is approaching, ensuring you have ample time to take action.
