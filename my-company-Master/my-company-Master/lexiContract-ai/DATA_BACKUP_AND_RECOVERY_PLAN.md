# LexiContract AI - Data Backup and Recovery Plan

**Policy ID:** LXP-SEC-004
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2023-10-28
**Owner:** Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
**Review Cycle:** Annual

## 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the strategy and procedures for backing up and recovering critical data for the LexiContract AI platform. This plan ensures the timely restoration of services and data integrity in the event of a hardware failure, software corruption, data-level disaster, or other disruptive incidents. This plan is a key component of our SOC 2 compliance program.

## 2.0 Scope

This plan applies to all production data, with the highest priority placed on the production PostgreSQL database, which contains all customer metadata, user information, and application state. Customer-uploaded documents are stored in a separate, versioned, and replicated object store (e.g., AWS S3) and are not covered by this specific database recovery plan.

## 3.0 Roles and Responsibilities

*   **CTO:** Accountable for the overall success of the backup and recovery strategy.
*   **DevOps/SRE Team:** Responsible for the implementation, maintenance, and regular testing of the backup and recovery systems.
*   **Incident Commander:** Responsible for initiating and coordinating the recovery process during a live incident, as defined in the Incident Response Plan (`LXP-SEC-003`).

## 4.0 Recovery Objectives

*   **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** 5 minutes. This is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time. Our use of continuous WAL archiving allows us to meet this objective.
*   **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 4 hours. This is the maximum acceptable time to restore the database service to a fully operational state after a disaster has been declared.

## 5.0 Backup Strategy

Our strategy for the production PostgreSQL database leverages Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR).

*   **Full Backups:**
    *   **Method:** A full physical backup of the database cluster will be taken using `pg_basebackup`.
    *   **Frequency:** Once per week (every Sunday at 02:00 UTC).
    *   **Retention:** Full backups are retained for 30 days.

*   **Incremental Backups (WAL Archiving):**
    *   **Method:** Write-Ahead Log (WAL) files are continuously archived to secure, remote storage.
    *   **Frequency:** Continuous.
    *   **Retention:** WAL archives are retained for 14 days, ensuring we can perform a PITR to any point within the last two weeks.

*   **Storage:**
    *   All backup files (full and WAL) are encrypted before being transferred to a secure, access-controlled cloud object storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3).
    *   The backup storage bucket is located in a different geographical region from the production database to protect against regional disasters.

## 6.0 Recovery Procedure

In the event of a declared incident requiring data restoration, the on-call engineer, under the direction of the Incident Commander, will perform the following high-level steps:
1.  Provision a new, clean database server instance.
2.  Retrieve the latest full backup and all subsequent WAL files from the secure storage bucket.
3.  Restore the full backup to the new instance.
4.  Replay the WAL files to bring the database to the desired point in time (typically the moment just before the incident occurred).
5.  Perform data integrity checks and validation.
6.  Update application connection strings and route traffic to the restored database instance.

## 7.0 Testing and Validation

*   **Frequency:** The recovery procedure will be tested on a quarterly basis.
*   **Method:** A full restoration of the production backup will be performed in an isolated staging environment. The test will be considered successful if the database is restored within the defined RTO and data is verified as being consistent.
*   **Documentation:** The results of each test, including timing and any issues encountered, will be documented and reviewed by the CTO.
