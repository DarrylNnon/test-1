**Subject: New Feature: Instantly Flag GDPR & CCPA Risks in Your Contracts**

Hi [Customer Name],

Manually checking every contract for compliance with complex regulations like GDPR and CCPA is time-consuming and carries significant risk. A single missed clause can lead to serious consequences.

Today, we're thrilled to announce a powerful new feature designed to solve this problem: **Advanced Compliance Modules**.

Available now for all Enterprise plan customers, our first module automatically scans your contracts for critical data privacy clauses related to GDPR and CCPA. The moment you upload a contract, LexiContract AI will instantly flag language concerning:

*   Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)
*   Definitions of Personal Data
*   Data Subject Rights
*   Cross-Border Data Transfers
*   Breach Notification Timelines

These new compliance checks appear alongside our standard AI analysis, giving your legal team a more complete picture of contractual risk in seconds, not days.

This feature is automatically enabled for your organization. Simply upload your next contract to see it in action.

Thank you for being a valued LexiContract AI customer.

Best,
The LexiContract AI Team
