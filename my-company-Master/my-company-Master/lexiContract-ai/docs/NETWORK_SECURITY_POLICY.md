# LexiContract AI - Network Security Policy

**Policy ID:** LXP-SEC-005
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2023-10-28
**Owner:** Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
**Review Cycle:** Annual

## 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to establish the rules and controls for securing LexiContract AI's network infrastructure. It defines requirements for network segmentation, firewall configuration, and remote access to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access and network-based attacks, in accordance with the Information Security Policy (`LXP-SEC-001`).

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to all of LexiContract AI's cloud and corporate network environments, including all Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, security groups, network access control lists (NACLs), and firewalls.

## 3.0 Network Segmentation

To limit the impact of a potential compromise, the network shall be segmented based on the sensitivity of the environment.

*   **3.1 Environment Isolation:** Production, Staging, and Development environments must be deployed in logically separate networks (e.g., separate VPCs or heavily restricted subnets). By default, all traffic between these distinct environments is denied.
*   **3.2 Production Tiering:** The production network must be segmented into multiple security zones (tiers), such as a public-facing DMZ and a private application/data tier.
*   **3.3 Data Tier Isolation:** Critical data stores, such as the production PostgreSQL database, must be located in a private subnet with no direct ingress or egress path to the public internet. Access to the data tier is restricted to specific application servers only.

## 4.0 Firewall and Access Control Policy

*   **4.1 Deny by Default:** All firewalls, security groups, and NACLs must be configured with a default-deny rule for both ingress and egress traffic. Only traffic that is explicitly permitted for a documented business purpose shall be allowed.
*   **4.2 Ingress Filtering:** Ingress traffic from the public internet is restricted to approved services on specific ports (e.g., TCP/443 for HTTPS traffic to the web application load balancer).
*   **4.3 Egress Filtering:** Egress traffic from the production environment to the internet must be restricted to only what is necessary for business operations (e.g., connections to specific third-party APIs like Stripe, OpenAI).
*   **4.4 Rule Management:**
    *   All changes to firewall rules must follow the `CHANGE_MANAGEMENT_POLICY.md` (LXP-SEC-002).
    *   Each firewall rule must have a documented owner, business justification, and be reviewed at least quarterly to ensure it is still required.

## 5.0 Secure Remote Access

*   **5.1 VPN/Bastion Host:** All administrative access to the production environment from any remote location must be established through a secure, centrally managed VPN or bastion host.
*   **5.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** All remote access sessions must be authenticated using MFA.
*   **5.3 No Direct Access:** Direct SSH or RDP access to production servers from the public internet is strictly prohibited.

## 6.0 Logging and Monitoring

*   **6.1 Network Flow Logs:** VPC flow logs (or equivalent) must be enabled for all production network segments.
*   **6.2 Log Analysis:** Logs shall be collected and analyzed by our security monitoring tools to detect anomalous traffic patterns and potential security incidents.

## 7.0 Policy Enforcement

Compliance with this policy will be enforced via automated infrastructure-as-code checks and periodic internal and external audits. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action.
