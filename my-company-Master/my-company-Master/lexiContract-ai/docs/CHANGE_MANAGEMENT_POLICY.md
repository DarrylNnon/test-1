# LexiContract AI - Change Management Policy

**Policy ID:** LXP-SEC-002
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2023-10-28
**Owner:** Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
**Review Cycle:** Annual

## 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of this Change Management Policy is to establish a standardized process for managing all changes to LexiContract AI's production environment. This includes changes to application code, infrastructure, system configurations, and third-party services. The goal is to minimize the risk of service disruption, security vulnerabilities, and operational instability while enabling rapid, high-quality development.

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to all permanent and temporary changes made to the production environment, including but not limited to:
*   Application code deployments.
*   Infrastructure modifications (managed via Terraform or other IaC tools).
*   Database schema migrations.
*   Changes to firewall rules, network configurations, and access controls.
*   Updates to third-party services or system dependencies.

This policy applies to all personnel involved in the software development lifecycle, including engineers, DevOps specialists, and technical leadership.

## 3.0 Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Change Requester:** Any engineer or authorized personnel who initiates a change. They are responsible for creating the change request, ensuring it is properly tested, and documenting the change.
*   **Change Approver:** A peer engineer or technical lead responsible for reviewing and approving a change. For high-risk changes, the CTO or a designated manager must also approve.
*   **Implementer:** The individual (typically the Change Requester) responsible for deploying the approved change to the production environment.

## 4.0 Standard Change Process

All standard (non-emergency) changes must follow this process, which is managed primarily through our source control system (e.g., GitHub).

*   **4.1 Change Request (CR):** A change is initiated via a Pull Request (PR) from a feature branch to the main branch. The PR description must include:
    *   A clear description of the change and its purpose.
    *   The associated task or ticket number from our project management system.
    *   An assessment of the potential risk and impact.
    *   A summary of testing performed.
    *   A rollback plan, if applicable.

*   **4.2 Peer Review and Approval:**
    *   All changes require at least one approval from a qualified peer (Change Approver).
    *   The review must assess the change for correctness, adherence to coding standards, security implications, and test coverage.
    *   Approval is formally logged through the source control platform's review feature.

*   **4.3 Automated Testing:**
    *   All PRs must pass the full suite of automated tests in our CI/CD pipeline before they can be merged. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and static code analysis (SAST).
    *   End-to-end (E2E) tests must also pass for changes affecting critical user workflows.

*   **4.4 Implementation:**
    *   Once approved and all checks have passed, the change can be merged into the main branch.
    *   Deployment to production is automated via our CD pipeline, triggered by the merge.

*   **4.5 Post-Implementation Verification:**
    *   The Implementer is responsible for monitoring the system immediately after deployment to verify the change was successful and did not introduce any adverse effects.

## 5.0 Emergency Change Process

An emergency change is a change that must be implemented immediately to restore service, fix a critical security vulnerability, or prevent a significant business impact.

*   **5.1 Verbal Approval:** The change must receive verbal or written (e.g., chat) approval from the CTO or a designated on-call manager.
*   **5.2 Implementation:** The change can be implemented immediately.
*   **5.3 Retrospective Documentation:** Within one (1) business day of the emergency change, a corresponding PR and documentation must be created retrospectively to ensure the change is formally recorded and reviewed. This is critical for audit purposes.

## 6.0 Auditing and Traceability

All change management activities are recorded to ensure a complete audit trail.
*   Our source control system (GitHub) serves as the primary log for all code changes, reviews, and approvals.
*   Our CI/CD system logs all builds, tests, and deployments.
*   Significant changes will also generate an entry in the platform's Audit Log, as described in policy `LXP-SEC-001`.

## 7.0 Policy Enforcement

Adherence to this policy is mandatory. Branch protection rules in our source control system will be configured to technically enforce the approval and testing requirements. Deviations from this policy will be reviewed by management and may result in disciplinary action.
