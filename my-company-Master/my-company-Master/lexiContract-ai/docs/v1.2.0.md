# Release Notes: Version 1.2.0

**Release Date:** 2023-10-28
**Focus:** Enterprise-Grade Compliance Automation

---

## Overview

This release introduces the **Advanced Compliance Modules**, a powerful new engine designed to automatically scan contracts for adherence to specific legal and regulatory standards. This feature is a significant step towards our goal of providing a comprehensive, end-to-end contract lifecycle management platform.

## âœ¨ New Features

### 1. Advanced Compliance Modules Framework

*   A new, extensible backend framework has been implemented to support rule-based "Playbooks" for contract analysis. This allows us to rapidly develop and deploy new compliance checks in the future.
*   This feature is automatically enabled for all organizations on the **Enterprise** subscription plan.

### 2. GDPR/CCPA PII Detection Playbook

*   The first playbook available in our new framework is focused on data privacy. When an enterprise user uploads a contract, LexiContract AI will now automatically scan for and flag clauses related to:
    *   References to a Data Processing Agreement (DPA).
    *   Definitions of "Personal Data" or "PII".
    *   Language concerning Data Subject Rights (e.g., right to access, erasure).
    *   Clauses about Cross-Border Data Transfers (e.g., SCCs).
    *   Data Breach Notification obligations.
*   Findings are seamlessly integrated into the existing contract analysis view, categorized under "Data Privacy," "Compliance," or "Security" to provide immediate, actionable insights.
