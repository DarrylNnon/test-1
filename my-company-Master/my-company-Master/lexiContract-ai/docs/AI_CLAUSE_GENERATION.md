# Technical Specification: AI-Powered Clause Generation

**Document ID:** LXP-TS-018
**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Gemini Code Assist, Lead Engineer
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical design for the "AI-Powered Clause Generation" feature. This initiative will empower users to generate new, compliant, and contextually-aware contract clauses directly within the editor from simple natural language prompts. This moves our AI capabilities from analysis and suggestion to active content creation, significantly speeding up the drafting process.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide an intuitive UI within the collaborative editor for users to generate clauses.
*   Accept natural language prompts (e.g., "Generate a standard confidentiality clause for a mutual NDA").
*   Generate legally sound and contextually relevant clauses.
*   Allow users to insert the generated clause directly into the contract text.

## 3. Backend Architecture

### 3.1. New API Endpoint (`api/v1/endpoints/drafting.py`)

A new endpoint will be created to handle clause generation requests.

*   `POST /api/v1/drafting/generate-clause`:
    *   **Request Body:**
        *   `prompt` (String): The user's natural language request.
        *   `context` (Object, optional): Additional context, such as `contract_type` or `industry`, to improve the quality of the generated clause.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  The endpoint receives the prompt and context.
        2.  It constructs a more detailed prompt for the LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4). This "meta-prompt" will instruct the model to act as a legal expert, generate a neutral and compliant clause, and adhere to a specific format.
        3.  It calls the LLM service with the constructed prompt.
        4.  It receives the generated text, performs any necessary sanitization, and returns it to the client.

### 3.2. Prompt Engineering

The quality of the generated clauses will depend heavily on the quality of our meta-prompt.

*   **Initial Meta-Prompt:**
    ```
    You are a legal assistant specializing in contract law. Your task is to generate a clear, concise, and legally sound contract clause based on the user's request. The clause should be neutral and suitable for a standard commercial agreement.

    User Request: "{user_prompt}"

    Context:
    - Contract Type: {contract_type}

    Generated Clause:
    ```
*   **Future Enhancements:** We can enhance the prompt by including examples from the user's own clause library to match their preferred style and terminology.

## 4. Frontend Architecture

### 4.1. Editor Integration (TipTap)

We will leverage TipTap's extensibility to create a user-friendly interface for this feature.

*   **Trigger:** A slash command (`/generate`) or a dedicated button in the editor's toolbar will activate the feature.
*   **UI:**
    1.  Activating the feature will open a small, non-intrusive popover or modal.
    2.  The user will type their natural language prompt into an input field within the popover.
    3.  Submitting the prompt will show a loading state.
    4.  When the backend returns the generated clause, it will be displayed within the popover for review.
    5.  An "Insert" button will replace the user's original slash command (or insert at the cursor position) with the generated text.

## 5. Rollout Plan

1.  **Sprint 1 (Backend & LLM):** Implement the `POST /drafting/generate-clause` endpoint and integrate with the OpenAI API. Develop and test the initial meta-prompt.
2.  **Sprint 2 (Frontend UI):** Build the slash command trigger and the prompt input UI within the TipTap editor.
3.  **Sprint 3 (End-to-End Integration):** Connect the frontend UI to the backend endpoint. Implement the logic for inserting the generated text into the editor.
4.  **Sprint 4 (Refinement & Testing):** Refine the user experience and write E2E tests for the clause generation workflow.
