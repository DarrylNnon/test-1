# LexiContract AI - Technical Architecture

This document outlines the high-level technical architecture for the LexiContract AI platform. The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, following modern DevSecOps best practices.

## 1. Core Principles

*   **Security First:** Every component is designed with security in mind, from data encryption to access control.
*   **Scalability:** The system is built on a microservices architecture to scale components independently.
*   **Automation:** CI/CD pipelines automate testing, security scanning, and deployment.
*   **Modularity:** Services are loosely coupled, allowing for easier updates and maintenance.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Framework:** Next.js (React) for a fast, server-rendered user interface.
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
    *   **State Management:** Zustand or Redux Toolkit.

*   **Backend (API Gateway & Core Services):**
    *   **Language/Framework:** Python with FastAPI for high-performance, async APIs.
    *   **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 / JWT for secure, stateless authentication.

*   **AI/ML Service:**
    *   **Core Logic:** Python, using libraries like `LangChain`, `spaCy`, and `Hugging Face Transformers`.
    *   **Models:** Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) hosted privately for security and performance. The models will be trained for legal entity recognition, clause classification, and risk summarization.

*   **Databases:**
    *   **Primary:** PostgreSQL for storing user data, contract metadata, and relational information.
    *   **Vector Database:** ChromaDB or Pinecone for enabling semantic search on contract clauses and documents.
    *   **Document Storage:** AWS S3 (or equivalent) with server-side encryption for secure storage of uploaded contracts.

*   **Infrastructure & Deployment:**
    *   **Containerization:** Docker.
    *   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, or AKS) for managing and scaling containerized applications.
    *   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for building, testing, and deploying code.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform to manage cloud resources programmatically.
    *   **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, and an APM tool (e.g., Datadog) for observability.
