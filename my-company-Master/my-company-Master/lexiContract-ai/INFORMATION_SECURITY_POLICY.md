# LexiContract AI - Information Security Policy

**Policy ID:** LXP-SEC-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** 2023-10-28
**Owner:** Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
**Review Cycle:** Annual

## 1.0 Purpose

The purpose of this Information Security Policy is to establish a framework of controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of LexiContract AI's information assets and our customers' data. This policy ensures that we meet our legal, regulatory, and contractual obligations, particularly those related to SOC 2 compliance, and provides a secure environment for our employees, partners, and customers.

## 2.0 Scope

This policy applies to all LexiContract AI employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to our information systems, data, and networks. It covers all information assets, including but not limited to customer data, intellectual property, financial information, and employee records, regardless of their form (digital or physical) or location (cloud infrastructure, office premises, or remote endpoints).

## 3.0 Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Chief Technology Officer (CTO):** The CTO is the ultimate owner of this policy and is responsible for ensuring it is implemented, maintained, and adequately funded.
*   **Security Officer:** A designated Security Officer is responsible for the day-to-day management of the security program, including risk assessments, incident response coordination, and security awareness training.
*   **All Personnel:** All employees and contractors are responsible for understanding and adhering to this policy and reporting any suspected security incidents or vulnerabilities immediately.

## 4.0 Information Classification

All information assets must be classified according to their sensitivity to guide handling and protection requirements.

*   **Level 4: Restricted:** Highly sensitive data (e.g., customer contract content, production encryption keys, user credentials). Unauthorized disclosure could have a catastrophic impact. Requires the highest level of security controls.
*   **Level 3: Confidential:** Sensitive business or personal data (e.g., financial reports, PII, source code). Unauthorized disclosure could have a significant adverse impact.
*   **Level 2: Internal:** Information intended for internal use only (e.g., internal documentation, project plans). Unauthorized disclosure could have a minor adverse impact.
*   **Level 1: Public:** Information cleared for public release (e.g., marketing materials, public website content).

## 5.0 Access Control

Access to information systems and data shall be granted based on the principle of least privilege and role-based access control (RBAC).

*   **5.1 User Access:** Unique user IDs must be assigned to all personnel. Shared accounts are prohibited.
*   **5.2 Authentication:** All access to systems containing Confidential or Restricted data must be protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA). Passwords must meet complexity requirements and be changed periodically.
*   **5.3 Access Reviews:** User access rights shall be reviewed on a quarterly basis and immediately upon termination or change of role.
*   **5.4 Privileged Access:** Access to administrative functions and production environments is strictly limited to authorized personnel. All privileged access activities must be logged and monitored.

## 6.0 Data Protection

*   **6.1 Encryption:**
    *   **In Transit:** All data transmitted over public networks must be encrypted using strong, industry-standard protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2+).
    *   **At Rest:** All customer data and internal data classified as Confidential or higher must be encrypted at rest using strong algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
*   **6.2 Data Handling:** Personnel must not copy, move, or store Restricted or Confidential data on unapproved devices or services (e.g., personal laptops, public cloud storage).
*   **6.3 Secure Disposal:** Digital media containing sensitive data must be securely wiped or destroyed before disposal. Physical documents must be shredded.

## 7.0 System and Network Security

*   **7.1 Network Segmentation:** Production environments must be logically isolated from development and corporate networks.
*   **7.2 Firewalls:** Firewalls must be configured to deny all traffic by default, only allowing traffic necessary for business purposes.
*   **7.3 Vulnerability Management:** Automated vulnerability scanning shall be performed regularly on all systems. Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities must be remediated within defined timelines.

## 8.0 Secure Software Development

*   **8.1 Secure Coding:** All development must follow secure coding best practices (e.g., OWASP Top 10).
*   **8.2 Change Management:** All changes to production systems, including code deployments and infrastructure modifications, must follow a formal change management process. (See `Change Management Policy LXP-SEC-002`).
*   **8.3 Testing:** All code must undergo security testing, including static analysis (SAST) and peer review, before being deployed to production.

## 9.0 Incident Response

LexiContract AI will maintain an Incident Response Plan to ensure security incidents are detected, contained, eradicated, and recovered from in a timely manner. All personnel must report suspected incidents immediately to the Security Officer. (See `Incident Response Plan LXP-SEC-003`).

## 10.0 Security Awareness and Training

All new hires must complete security awareness training as part of their onboarding. All personnel must complete annual refresher training to stay informed about current threats and policies.

## 11.0 Compliance and Enforcement

*   **Compliance:** This policy and its supporting procedures will be audited annually by an independent third party as part of our SOC 2 certification process.
*   **Enforcement:** Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, and may lead to legal action.
