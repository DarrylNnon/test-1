## How It Works: Automatic Extraction

The workflow begins automatically when you update a contract's status.

1.  Navigate to a contract you have finished negotiating.
2.  Change its status to **"SIGNED"**.

Behind the scenes, LexiContract AI will automatically re-analyze the document to find and extract key dates and actionable obligations.

## Using the Management Tab

Once a contract is signed and analyzed, a new **"Management"** tab will appear on the contract detail page. This is your central hub for tracking an active agreement.

*   **Key Dates Timeline:** This section provides a clear, visual timeline of the contract's lifecycle, showing extracted dates like the Effective Date, Expiration Date, and Renewal Notice Deadline.
*   **Tracked Obligations Table:** This table lists all the specific duties and commitments the AI found in the text. You can see who is responsible and, most importantly, update the **Status** of an obligation from "Pending" to "In Progress" or "Completed" as work gets done.

## Using the Renewals Dashboard

The Renewals Dashboard gives you a high-level view of your entire contract portfolio, helping you proactively manage upcoming expirations.

1.  Click on **"Renewals"** in the main navigation sidebar.
2.  The dashboard displays a table of all contracts that are set to expire or require a renewal decision soon.
3.  Use the filter tabs to view contracts that need attention in the **Next 30, 60, or 90 days**.
4.  From here, you can quickly link to any contract to review its terms and begin the renewal process.
