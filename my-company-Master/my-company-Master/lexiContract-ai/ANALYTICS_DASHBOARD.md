# Technical Specification: Advanced Analytics Dashboard

**Document ID:** LXP-TS-009
**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Gemini Code Assist, Lead Engineer
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the technical design for the "Advanced Analytics Dashboard." This feature provides organization leaders with a high-level, data-driven overview of their entire contract portfolio and negotiation process. It aggregates data on contract volume, risk exposure, and cycle times to provide actionable business intelligence.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide at-a-glance Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total contracts, average negotiation time, and contracts currently in review.
*   Visualize the distribution of risk categories across all analyzed contracts.
*   Show contract volume trends over time.
*   Create a scalable backend service to perform the necessary data aggregations efficiently.

## 3. Backend Architecture

### 3.1. New API Endpoint (`api/v1/endpoints/analytics.py`)

The existing `analytics.py` router will be enhanced with a new primary endpoint for this dashboard.

*   **`GET /api/v1/analytics/dashboard`**: This endpoint will aggregate all necessary data and return a single, consolidated JSON object.

    **Response Body (`schemas.FullAnalyticsDashboard`):**
    ```json
    {
      "kpis": { "total_contracts": 150, "contracts_in_progress": 25, "average_cycle_time_days": 8.5 },
      "risk_distribution": [
        { "category": "Liability", "count": 75 },
        { "category": "Unfavorable Terms", "count": 45 }
      ],
      "volume_over_time": [
        { "month": "2023-09", "count": 30 },
        { "month": "2023-10", "count": 50 }
      ]
    }
    ```

### 3.2. New Aggregation Functions (`core/crud.py`)

*   New functions will be created to perform optimized SQL queries for each part of the dashboard: `get_analytics_kpis`, `get_risk_category_distribution`, and `get_contract_volume_over_time`.

## 4. Frontend Architecture

*   **New Page (`/dashboard/analytics`):** A new page will be created to host the dashboard.
*   **Components:** The page will feature three main components:
    1.  **KPI Cards:** A set of cards displaying the key metrics.
    2.  **Risk Distribution Chart:** A bar chart showing the breakdown of risks.
    3.  **Volume Chart:** A line chart showing contract creation volume over time.

## 5. Rollout Plan

1.  **Sprint 1 (Backend):** Implement the aggregation functions in `core/crud.py` and the new `/api/v1/analytics/dashboard` endpoint.
2.  **Sprint 2 (Frontend):** Build the new dashboard page and all associated data visualization components.
3.  **Sprint 3 (Integration & Testing):** Connect the frontend to the backend and write E2E tests to validate the data accuracy and UI.
